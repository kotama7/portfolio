# Personal Portfolio

This project is a small React application created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The goal of this app is to explain who I am by providing a simple portfolio with some background information and ways to contact me.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
